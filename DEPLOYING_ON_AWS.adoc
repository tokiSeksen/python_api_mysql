**2. AWS Architecture and Services:**

The architecture of this project consists of creating services based on Lambda functions. The lambda autoscaling
allows us to dynamically adapt to the amount of incoming requests. APIs are exposed through API Gateway, providing
a centralized entry point to the API. Through API Gateway it is also possible to manage authentication and authorization processes.
For the database part, we can use the RDS service, providing scaling options to fit the application needs.
Considering the high traffic, the CloudFront CDN service can be employed to optimize performance and improve content distribution.
In particular, we can use it to cache API calls and reduce latency during peaks of API calls.

**3. Deployment Process to Production:**

The first step of deployment in AWS is the use of deployment automation tools, in our case it is GitLab CI/CD
represented here with gitlab-ci.yml. It is important for managing the automatic sequence of build, test, and deployment.
This file helps maintain a smooth development flow.

During the build we must install all the necessary dependencies, compilation and packaging, for example with zip files
in the case of lambda.

For the testing phase in addition to unit tests we can also add integration tests to make sure that the different parts o
f the system work well together. Furthermore, we can use code analysis tools such as (e.g. sonarque) which can be an
integral part of continuous delivery.

For configuration and deployment in various environments, we can use tools like Terraform to simplify the process
and easily manage environment variables. By deploying, AWS SSM can help us manage these variables in centralized way.

After deployment, it is essential to monitor the service. Tools like CloudWatch can give us a clear view of performance
and alert us if there are problems. In those case some automatic measures can be taken, as an autoscaling of a resource or even
some automatic deployments.

We also need to plan a backup and recovery system to deal with emergency situations and ensure data security.
Finally, keeping documentation up to date is crucial. This helps the team understand the project and manage it efficiently over time.


**4.Monitoring**

In my opinion, the most important metrics include:

- the number of Lambda function invocations, which indicates the increase in traffic.
- the real execution time of the Lambda function.
- the total count of API Gateway requests.
- the time taken by API Gateway to respond to requests.
- 4xx and 5xx errors in API Gateway responses.
- database CPU usage to ensure it is not overloaded.
- free memory in the database, considering possible autoscaling.
- cloudFront error rate to identify any content delivery issues.
- cloudFront cache hit rate to evaluate cache effectiveness.

These metrics can be effectively managed through a Lambda function that is subscribed to an SNS topic
to send notifications via email or messages.


**5.Security**

Some best practices may include:

- Implement a strong authentication system using standard protocols such as, for example, OAuth 2.0 with the use of tokens.
- Use the HTTPS protocol to ensure secure communication between the client and the server.
- Deploy resources from each environment to different AWS Regions
- Carefully configure the security groups of resources, such as VPCs, to ensure adequate access control.
- Apply throttling mechanisms to manage and control the number of requests coming from users.
- Use monitoring tools, previously described, and implement automatic alarms, also with automatic deployment processes.
- Adopt secure and strong hashing algorithms to ensure information integrity and security.
- Keep the dependencies and libraries used in the system updated.
- Implement effective solutions for data backup and recovery, ensuring the availability of information in the event of loss or damage.
